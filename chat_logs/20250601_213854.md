### You

What does it say in the Earnable course about next steps from here? By that I mean, I am about 75% done with this client, it's a first time project, what now? Build a website? Do marketing? Please summarize

### Coach

Great question—this is a key moment in any client project, and Earnable has some clear guidance on what to do around the 75% mark, especially for a first-time client.

**Here’s what Earnable recommends at this stage:**

1. **Start Prepping for Validation & Feedback**  
Don’t wait until you’re “done” to check in. Around 75% completion is the right time to:
   - Share what you’ve built so far (even if it’s not perfect).
   - Ask for focused, constructive feedback.
   - Confirm you’re heading in the right direction for their needs.

2. **Get Clear on What They Value Most**  
Instead of just pushing forward on mechanics (website build, marketing, etc.), pause to make sure what you’re creating actually matches what they care about. Earnable really emphasizes *frontloading* conversations to understand their true priorities, not just what you *think* they want.

3. **Invite Them In**  
Consider inviting your client to a quick “advisory council” review—just a 15–20 minute session where they walk through what you’ve done and offer real, honest input. Let them know you want constructive feedback, not just compliments.

4. **Use Feedback to Adjust—Not Just Finish**  
If you get feedback that suggests a pivot or tweak, don’t treat it as a setback. It’s validation! Make those adjustments now, not after launch.

**Should you focus on building, marketing, or something else?**  
At 75% done, Earnable doesn’t say to just “keep building” or “start marketing.” Instead, focus on *client validation and alignment*. The main priorities are:
- Validate that you’re on the right track
- Deepen your understanding of what the client really values
- Adjust your work based on real feedback

**Summary:**  
Don’t just power through to the finish line. Pause at 75% to check in with your client, validate your direction, and make sure you’re building something they truly want and will value. This step will save you from wasted effort and help you deliver a result they’ll rave about (and potentially refer others for).

**Follow-up for you:**  
What feedback (if any) have you already received from Terrapin so far? Would you feel comfortable inviting them to a quick review of what’s been built, or do you see any obstacles to doing that?
