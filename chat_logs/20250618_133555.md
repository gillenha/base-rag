That's a lot to start off with. If I had to distill it down, it would be: higher prices, fewer customers. That's the end goal. But what to sell? What service do I package? Start small, move in that direction

### Coach

Great question—this is exactly the kind of strategic thinking that sets you up for long-term success and less burnout.

You’re already doing $1,500 projects for website development/upgrades, which tells me you have the skills and enough credibility to get results for clients. Now, to move up the value chain (fewer clients, higher prices), you’ll want to shift your focus from being a “website builder” to being a *business partner* who drives specific, high-impact results.

Here’s how you can start moving in that direction:

### 1. **Find Out What Your Clients *Really* Want (Beyond a Website)**
Clients don’t wake up wanting a prettier website. They want:
- More leads
- More sales
- Better credibility
- Easier client onboarding
- Automation/time savings

**Action:**  
Review your last few clients—what were their real goals? If you’re not sure, follow up and ask! (“Now that your site is live, what’s been the biggest impact for you?”)

### 2. **Package a Solution, Not Just a Website**
Instead of selling “website development,” package an *outcome* that directly impacts your client’s bottom line or solves a painful problem. For example:
- “Lead Generation Website Overhaul” — includes web redesign, copy optimization, lead magnet setup, and analytics tracking.
- “High-Ticket Service Provider Authority Package” — website upgrade, credibility-building content, simple sales funnel setup.

The more you can tie your work to their business results, the easier it is to charge premium prices.

### 3. **Add High-Touch, High-Value Elements**
Consider including things like:
- Strategy sessions (discovery, positioning, offer refinement)
- Done-for-you copywriting/SEO
- Integrations with CRM/email for automation
- Analytics setup and training

These let you charge more *and* work with clients who value your expertise, not just your coding.

### 4. **Position Yourself as a Partner, Not a Vendor**
Shift your messaging from “I build websites” to “I help [ideal client] get [specific result] using strategic website upgrades.”

### 5. **Test a Premium Package**
Take what you’ve learned and create a $3,000–$5,000 offer with a clear, results-focused deliverable. The first few times, you might pitch it to past clients or referrals who already trust you.

**Let’s dig deeper:**  
- What have your clients *said* was most valuable to them after the project was done? (Traffic, leads, looking more professional, etc?)
- Do you have a favorite type of client or project that feels easier or more fun for you?
- Are there business results you feel confident you can help deliver, beyond “a better website”?

Your answers will help us sketch out your premium offer together.
