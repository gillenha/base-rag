### Earnable Coach Response

### You

What does Earnable say about when and how to build a website? I know there is a source in here about building a course online, that you charge customers for. But that always struck me as a little ponzi scheme-esque. I just rebuilt a website for a customer, is that my service? I'm probably overthinking this

### Coach

Earnable addresses building a website in the context of starting and growing your business, but it does not recommend building a website as the first step. The course emphasizes validating your offer and getting paying clients before investing significant time or money into a website.

**Relevant points from Earnable:**

- In the early stages, Earnable teaches to focus on talking to potential customers, validating your offer, and making sales before building a website. (Source: Earnable core modules, Offer Validation section)
- A website is positioned as a tool to help automate and scale your business after you have a validated offer and paying clients. The course provides guidance on "how to set up a website that converts" as part of building a perpetual sales machine, but this comes after initial validation and sales. (Source: Earnable, Scaling and Automation modules)
- Earnable does not teach or endorse building a course and selling it to customers without delivering value; it emphasizes creating offers that solve real problems for real people, based on research and feedback. (Source: Offer Creation and Validation modules)

**Regarding your service:**
- If you rebuilt a website for a customer and charged for it, that is a valid service offering. Website development and upgrades are legitimate services if they solve a problem your client cares about and is willing to pay for. (Source: Earnable, Service Business Examples)

**Summary of Earnable’s process:**
1. Validate your offer by talking to potential customers and making sales.
2. Once you have paying clients and a validated offer, consider building a website to support and scale your business.
3. Focus on delivering real value, not just creating products or courses for the sake of selling them.

If you are offering website development as a service and clients are paying for it, that aligns with Earnable’s approach to service businesses.
