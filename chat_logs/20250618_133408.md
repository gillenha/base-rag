### Earnable Coach Response

### You

Well, it's a few days later, let's kick things off. I am a human, so I make human mistakes. But you are trained on the Earnable course, where should we begin here?

### Coach

Great to have you back! And I love the honesty—mistakes are part of the process, especially when you’re building something new. Let’s meet you right where you are.

You’ve recently sold a website development or upgrade service for $1,500. That’s a solid start, congrats! Before we dive into tactics, let’s zoom out just a little.

Here’s what I’d like to understand so I can coach you best:
1. **Clients & Outcomes:** Who was your last client, and what were they looking for beyond “a website upgrade”? What did they actually want to accomplish, and how did they define success?
2. **Your Experience:** How did the sales and delivery process feel for you? Were there any friction points (pricing discussions, scope creep, client communication, tech headaches)?
3. **Your Goals:** What would make the next 3–6 months feel like a win for you? Is it more clients, higher prices, easier projects, more free time?
4. **Ideal Client:** Who do you *want* to be working with? Are there certain industries, business types, or personalities that you really enjoy—or want to avoid?
5. **Offer & Positioning:** How are you currently packaging and describing your service? Is it “I build websites,” or do you talk about the business impact (like more leads, easier sales, etc.)?

Let’s start with whichever of those questions resonates most. Where do you want to dig in first?
