Going further, I didn't necessarily build a new website for a client, I built an inbound service. Evesales, every business needs more sales that is, but they don't always have the time to build an inbound process for collecting interested prospects. What does Earnable say about setting this up?

### Coach

Earnable covers the concept of building systems to attract and convert prospects as part of creating a scalable business. The course specifically addresses inbound systems in the context of automating lead generation and nurturing, but it emphasizes that these systems should be built after you have validated your offer and have paying clients.

**Key points from Earnable regarding inbound services:**

- Earnable teaches that after validating your offer and getting initial sales, you can set up systems to generate "revenue as you sleep." This includes setting up a website that converts, finding your audience, and creating an "automatic, perpetual sales machine." (Source: Earnable, Scaling and Automation modules)
- The course describes a process where a prospect finds your content (e.g., via Google), visits your website, and is prompted to enter their email for a lead magnet. They then receive a series of automated, value-driven emails that nurture the relationship and eventually present an offer. (Source: Earnable, Perpetual Sales Machine walkthrough)
- Earnable provides frameworks for setting up these inbound systems, including:
  - Creating lead magnets or opt-in offers to capture emails
  - Building automated email sequences to nurture leads
  - Using your website and content to attract and convert prospects

**Regarding offering inbound systems as a service:**
- Earnable recognizes that many businesses need help setting up inbound processes because they lack the time or expertise. Providing a service that builds these systems for clients is a valid and valuable offer, as long as it addresses a real need and clients are willing to pay for it. (Source: Earnable, Service Business Examples and Offer Validation modules)
- The course stresses the importance of customer research to ensure that your inbound service solves a problem your target clients care about and are actively seeking to solve.

**Summary of Earnable’s approach:**
1. Validate that businesses want and will pay for an inbound system.
2. Build and deliver the inbound system (e.g., lead capture, automated follow-up) as a service.
3. Ensure your service is focused on solving the client’s real problem (e.g., needing more sales, lacking time to set up inbound).

Earnable supports offering inbound systems as a service, provided it is based on validated demand and delivers tangible value to clients.
