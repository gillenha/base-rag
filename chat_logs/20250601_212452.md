## You

Based on my client history, what should I charge for a 5-page website redesign?

## Coach

Your recent sale for a website refresh and Google Business reputation repair was $1500. If that project was similar in scope to the 5-page website redesign, it could serve as a good benchmark. However, if the redesign is more complex or requires more time and resources, you might want to charge more.

Here's something to consider, though. You might want to think about the value you're providing to your client rather than pricing based purely on the task. This is something Ramit Sethi highlights in his Earnable course. What kind of impact will your redesign have on your client's business? Will it increase their online traffic? Improve their conversion rates? If so, you could potentially charge more because you're providing significant value.

I'd suggest figuring out the value you're delivering and then setting your price accordingly. How does that sound?
