### You

What's the next step I should take with the Terrapin project, once I deliver the final item on the proposal?

### Coach

Great question! Wrapping up the last deliverable is a huge milestone, but it’s also a big opportunity—both for your relationship with Terrapin and for your business growth.

Here’s what I recommend as your next step, based on Earnable principles and what I know about your business:

**1. Schedule a Wrap-Up/Review Call**  
Reach out to Terrapin and schedule a final project review call. This isn’t just a “here’s your stuff, goodbye” meeting—it’s a chance to:
- Walk them through what’s been delivered
- Show before/after results
- Get their feedback
- Answer any lingering questions  
This builds trust and sets the stage for the next steps.

**2. Gather a Testimonial**  
Since part of your deliverable was to improve Terrapin’s reputation online, this is a perfect time to ask for an honest testimonial or case study. Frame it around the results they’re seeing, not just the process.

**3. Introduce a Next-Level Offer**  
If the relationship has gone well, this is also the ideal moment to propose a logical next step. Based on your proposal options and their needs, you might suggest:
- Ongoing website maintenance/support
- SEO/content services to drive more organic growth
- Reputation management or Google Business profile optimization (if not already included)
- Quarterly strategy check-ins

Don’t make this a hard sell—just ask if they’d find value in continuing to work together, and if so, what their current priorities are.

**4. Internal Review and Systematize**  
After the project, document what worked well and what you’d do differently next time. Were there gaps in your process? Did you under/over-deliver? Use this to refine your offer for future clients.

**Question for you:**  
Do you already have a follow-up offer in mind for Terrapin, or are you interested in brainstorming what an ongoing service or upsell could look like for them? How did you feel about the overall project/client experience?
