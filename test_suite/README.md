## Key Components

### 1. Quality Metrics System (`metrics/quality_metrics.py`)

**Purpose**: Measures response quality across five key dimensions:

- **Ramit Authenticity (25% weight)**: How well response captures Ramit's voice and terminology
- **Framework Coherence (25% weight)**: Accuracy of framework representation and connections
- **Actionability (20% weight)**: Implementability and specific guidance quality
- **Source Accuracy (15% weight)**: How well response is supported by retrieved content
- **Coaching Effectiveness (15% weight)**: Ability to guide user thinking forward

**Key Features**:
- Signature phrase detection ("Business isn't magic. It's math.")
- Contrarian element identification
- Framework terminology analysis
- Tactical language assessment
- Coaching progression evaluation

**Usage**:
```python
from test_suite.metrics.quality_metrics import ResponseQualityAnalyzer

analyzer = ResponseQualityAnalyzer()
scores = analyzer.analyze_response_quality(response, query, sources)
print(f"Overall Score: {scores.overall_score:.2f}/5.0")
print(f"Ramit Authenticity: {scores.ramit_authenticity:.2f}/5.0")
```

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite (`comprehensive_test_suite.py`)

**Purpose**: End-to-end validation across all query types and scenarios.

**Test Categories**:
- **Framework Queries**: Tests understanding of Ramit's specific methodologies

```

## Test Data Structure

### Query Categories and Expected Behaviors

**Framework Queries**:
- Expected: High framework coherence, systematic explanations
- Example: "What is Ramit's customer research framework?"
- Validation: Mentions specific components, step-by-step process

**Tactical Queries**:
- Expected: High actionability, specific scripts and steps
- Example: "Give me the exact script for following up with prospects"
- Validation: Contains "exact," numbered steps, implementable guidance

**Contrarian Queries**:
- Expected: Challenges conventional wisdom, uses contrarian language
- Example: "Should I follow my passion to build a business?"
- Validation: Contains "backwards," "conventional wisdom," alternative approach

**Mindset Queries**:
- Expected: Addresses psychology, invisible scripts, reframing
- Example: "I'm afraid to charge high prices"
- Validation: Mentions limiting beliefs, psychological barriers, reframing

## Quality Scoring System

### Score Ranges
- **5.0**: Excellent - Indistinguishable from Ramit's actual coaching
- **4.0**: Good - Strong Ramit voice with minor gaps
- **3.0**: Acceptable - Adequate quality with some Ramit elements
- **2.0**: Poor - Generic advice with minimal Ramit characteristics
- **1.0**: Failing - No Ramit elements, potentially incorrect information

### Ramit Authenticity Indicators

**Signature Phrases** (High value):
- "Business isn't magic. It's math."
- "Systems beat goals."
- "Start before you're ready."
- "Focus on your first paying customer."

**Contrarian Openers** (Medium value):
- "Here's where most people get this wrong:"
- "Conventional wisdom says X, but that's backwards."
- "Everyone tells you to do X. That's terrible advice."

**Framework Language** (Medium value):
- "Customer research," "Mind reading," "Winning offer"
- "Authentic selling," "Profit playbook"
- "Invisible scripts," "Money dial"

**Tactical Language** (Medium value):
- "Here's exactly what to do:"

- Check Ramit analysis metadata in vector store
- Review context-aware prompting configuration

**"Memory usage growing over time"**:
- Monitor conversation memory cleanup
- Check for leaked references
- Review vector store connection pooling

**"Slow response times"**:

- Review prompt complexity and length

### Support and Debugging

1. **Enable verbose logging**:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=. 
   python test_suite/run_all_tests.py --all --verbose
   ```

2. **Run individual test components**:
   ```bash
   python test_suite/comprehensive_test_suite.py --categories framework
   python test_suite/multi_turn_testing.py
   ```

3. **Check system prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   python -c "
   import os
   print('API Key:', 'SET' if os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') else 'MISSING')
   print('Vector Store:', 'EXISTS' if os.path.exists('./chroma_db') else 'MISSING')
   "
   ```

This comprehensive testing system ensures the enhanced RAG pipeline consistently delivers high-quality, authentic Ramit Sethi coaching responses while maintaining system reliability and performance.
