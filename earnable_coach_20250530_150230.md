## You

What's the next step I should take with the Terrapin project, once I deliver the final item on the proposal?

## Coach

Great question! Since you’re about to deliver the final item for Terrapin’s project, this is a prime opportunity to deepen the relationship and potentially create more value for both of you.

Here’s what I recommend as your next step:

1. **Schedule a Debrief Call**  
   Set up a quick meeting after delivery. The purpose is to walk them through the completed work, answer any questions, and—most importantly—show them how to use and benefit from the new website and reputation improvements. This helps them see the immediate value and ensures nothing is left ambiguous.

2. **Gather Feedback**  
   Ask for candid feedback on both the deliverables and the process. You can frame this as wanting to continually improve how you serve clients (which is true). If you included a customer survey in your proposal, now’s the time to deploy it.

3. **Present a Roadmap for What’s Next**  
   Based on your knowledge of their business, identify 1–2 areas where you could help them next. For Terrapin, that might mean:
   - Ongoing website support/maintenance
   - SEO/content improvements to drive more organic leads
   - Reputation management follow-ups or additional media/social proof
  
   Prepare a “quick win” suggestion and a longer-term idea. This shows you’re invested in their ongoing success, not just a one-and-done vendor.

4. **Request a Testimonial or Case Study**  
   If they’re happy, this is the best time to ask for a testimonial or permission to write a case study. You can even offer to draft it for them, making it easy to say yes.

**Action Steps for You:**
- Schedule the debrief call (or send a wrap-up email if a call isn’t possible)
- Prepare a feedback request and your “what’s next” suggestions
- Draft a short testimonial request or case study outline

Let’s go deeper:  
What’s your read on Terrapin’s appetite for more services? Do they seem open to ongoing work, or are they more likely to want a pause after this project? This will help you tailor your approach for the follow-up conversation.
